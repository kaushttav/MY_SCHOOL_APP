        The school life is the best life. A man, who has been the student, 
        knows what school life is. The school life is the golden time period of learning. 
        It truly impacts the life of students. The importance of school life can never be 
        negated. The school life is important for children as well as for the grown up 
        students alike.

        We get good learning experience, the self confidence, motivation and the will to do 
        the best. It is the school life that blesses with best ever friends for the rest of 
        our life. The school life friends are like your old and sincere friends for the rest 
        of your life. The school days are the best days of our lives. I have the best school 
        life memories. They are like a treasure for me. The joys of school life are invaluable.<br><br>

        The school days are the best days of my life. I clearly remember my first day at school. 
        My first day school life memories are still vivid. I can still feel how warmly I was 
        welcomed at the school. That truly defines the importance of school life for a child.<br><br>

        As a child, I learned, cooperated, got myself motivated and groomed under the best 
        company of my best friends. I remember the first year love and wishes from my 
        teachers. That is why I always regard my primary school life memories as the 
        treasure for my life.
